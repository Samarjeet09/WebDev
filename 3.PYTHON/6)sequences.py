# jwhat are sequences
# data types that store values in some special ways

name = "heyy"
print(name[0])
# basically a string which is a array of character

# mutliple chize store karni hai
# LIST
names = ["sam", "pluto", "samarjeet"]
print(names)

# TUPLE
# when we want that values dont change but we wana store a pair value together
coordinateX = 10.4
coordinateY = 20.3
# we require to make 2 variables but
coordinate = (10.4, 20.3)
# now we can pass both values together
